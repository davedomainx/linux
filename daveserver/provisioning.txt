Issue with spacewalk after yum -y update.
spacewalk has alot of components/moving parts (foreman has even more but I
digress).

Had a closer look at spacewalk...

Spacewalk is (was) the upstream for Satellite <= 5, but looks like RedHat
went their own way for Satellite 6.

Probably should do the foreman ..

foreman seems to have morphed into a kitchen sink since i last looked at it..
