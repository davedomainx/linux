find the supermicro:
  ipmiview - search 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254
  will be at XX
  password is supermicro default
    I IPMI reset this; follow up with procedure on how to do this

find where daveserver is:

4.May
  daveserver didnt get IP set
  ip address change 192.168.0.17/24 dev eno1
  ip link set eno1 down
  ip link set eno1 up
  ah okay dhcp is giving me 0.20 not 0.17 as expected

7.May
  reconfig daveserver to 192.168.0.99/32
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno1
      IPADDR
      NETMASK
      GATEWAY
    Hmm, looks like something automatically converted
      NETMASK=255.255.255.0 => PREFIX=24
      BOOTPROTO=static => BOOTPROTO=none
  install ZoL

   8.May
     see atom/basics.txt; really need better git-log status message in atom

  20.May
    Disable NetworkManager yeah really.  Keeps messing around wih the virbr0 route
    Spacewalk died - downgraded c3p0 package.
    Spacewalk is (was) the upstream for Satellite <= 5, but looks like RedHat
    went their own way for Satellite 6.
    spacewalk has alot of components/moving parts.
    Probably should do the foreman ..

24.May
  foreman is up
  running into chicken and egg scenarios.
  use foreman to install a dhcp/dns VM
  but I need to turn off foremans own dhcpd/dns services
  ah okay i use foremans smart proxy and use ISC dhcp and bind DNS

25.May
  best way is to disable libvirtd's dnsmasq
  setup a bridge manually with the IP swap to the physical device

26.May
  dhclient was still kicking in and giving eno1 an ipaddress, even
  though that had been turned over to the bridge.  seems that if you
  have PEERDNS in other network interface configuraiton files, then dhclient
  will try and dhcp on ALL interfaces (!)  Could not find a way to turn this
  stupid off so removed the eno2 file.
