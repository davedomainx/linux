find where daveserver is:

4.May
  daveserver didnt get IP set
  ip address change 192.168.0.17/24 dev eno1
  ip link set eno1 down
  ip link set eno1 up
  ah okay dhcp is giving me 0.20 not 0.17 as expected

7.May
  reconfig daveserver to 192.168.0.99/32
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno1
      IPADDR
      NETMASK
      GATEWAY
    Hmm, looks like something automatically converted
      NETMASK=255.255.255.0 => PREFIX=24
      BOOTPROTO=static => BOOTPROTO=none
  install ZoL

     atom --wait from the git shell
     commits work from git-shell
