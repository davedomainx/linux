Issue with spacewalk after yum -y update.
spacewalk has alot of components/moving parts (foreman has even more but I
digress).

Had a closer look at spacewalk...

Spacewalk is (was) the upstream for Satellite <= 5, but looks like RedHat
went their own way for Satellite 6.

aha saw web comments that RedHat are ditching Satellite and moving to theforeman ?

=== theforeman ===

it is surprisingly dense and unintuitive to go through

=== theforeman -> qemu ===

# FIXME : Changed /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf to explictly stop using polkit
# couldnt stop error:

systemctl restart libvirtd

Websocket error when trying to access console of VM from foreman:
  Added daveserver.localdomain to windows hosts file
  run insecure https from localhost
  I think I clicked through on the striked-out https and then reloaded page,
  that seems to have worked
  er no it was using https://daveserver.localdomain as the URL that worked ..

 ERF12-6899 [ProxyAPI::ProxyException]: Unable to set DHCP entry ([RestClient::BadRequest]: 400 Bad Request) for proxy
   systemctl restart foreman-proxy.service

Firewalld blocking VNC console
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5910-5930/tcp # FIXME : better src restrictions

yum install -y foreman-console
 just one file, is it really doing anything ?

foreman-installer --list-scenarios
ls '/etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/

Ah okay I can direct-edit the Bridges in the daveserver.localdomain host

Finally got pxeboot working.. vmlinux and initrd were 0 bytes when copied from
the CentOS ISO ..

Hm I can connect using curl but not browser
  is firewall
  but then get "cannot read client cert from environment"
[root@daveserver foreman-proxy]# curl -k https://daveserver.localdomain:8443/features
["dhcp","dns","logs","puppet","puppetca","tftp"][root@daveserver foreman-proxy]#
[root@daveserver foreman-proxy]#

failed to fetch kickstart from daveserver.localdomain/unattended
 https://daveserver.localdomain/unattended/provision?spoof=192.168.122.123
 had wrong nameserver - dracut shell couldnt resolve daveserver
   didnt fix it ..
   localdomain is the problem ..
 allow firewalld nfsd ports
