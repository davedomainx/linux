Getting things into the system clipboard:

Inside Tmux:
1. tmux = copy-selection-and-cancel (drag+drop)
  a. vim inside tmux = shift and mouse select
  b. everything else = copy-selection-and-cancel (drag+drop)

Outside Tmux:
2. vim = shift and mouse select
3. firefox = autocopyselection2clipboard
4. konsole = double click, or select AND mouseclick (to force the copy)

==== X11
shift-select and middle-click seem to be related somehow ..
think this is X-Windows stuff

From https://askubuntu.com/questions/12047/inconsistent-copy-and-paste-behaviour-is-there-a-fix

Mode NAME    Text Copy method         Text Paste  method
----------   ---------------------    -------------------
PRIMARY      currently selected       mouse middle-click
CLIPBOARD    Control+C selection      Control+V

Lots of issues with tmux mouse copy-selection-and-cancel in vi[m]

screen-256 vs xterm-256 : no difference

konsole : edit current Profile : Mouse : "Copy on select" should be ticked

okay vim using shift-select can now copy to system clipboard, need to 
paste from system clipboard to vim..

vim has 0 as default register.  + is the system clipboard.  
vim needs to have +clipboard/+xterm_clipboard support ..

> vi --version|grep --color clipboard
+clipboard         +jumplist          +persistent_undo   +vertsplit
+emacs_tags        +mouse_dec         -sun_workshop      +xterm_clipboard

so it should be simply :set clipboard=unnamedplus

okay.  
mouse-select does not actually *copy* into the clipboard...
think this is X11 stuff - mouse select
you need to explictly ctrl-c to get things into the clipboard..

konsole # xprop _NET_WM_PID WM_CLASS (click in terminal)
  xterm-256 # echo $TERM
    tmux #
      vim #

===konsole 
	- select - ctrl c
		cant paste into vim..
	- select - right click - pastes to system clipboard
		weird ..

=== firefox 
	autocopyselection2clipboard (acs2c)
	unselect after copying : unticked (messes up google-search)
	copy notification : useful to see
	selection in input fields : unticked (if used, acs2c copies
						selected text in input
						fields to clipboard.
						just use ctrl-c to copy
						or rightlick copy)
						
===plasma/kubuntu clipboard
	
kubuntu clipboard - configure - sync contents of clipboard and selection

Yes, there's also another solution hidden for OP: Set the checkbox 
at Ignore selection and Plasma's clipboard manager will never 
overwrite your Ctrl-V clipboard again. If your clipboard content is 
overwritten with the PRIMARY selection contents, it's not X11's fault, 
it's usually a clipboard manager at work.

===xterm

xterm : ~/.Xresources:
xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \
                 Ctrl Shift <Key>V:    insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) \n\
                 Ctrl Shift <Key>C:    copy-selection(CLIPBOARD)
xterm*VT256.Translations: #override \
                 Ctrl Shift <Key>V:    insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) \n\
                 Ctrl Shift <Key>C:    copy-selection(CLIPBOARD)
xrdb ~/.Xresources
