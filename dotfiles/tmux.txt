Lots of issues with tmux mouse copy-selection-and-cancel in vi[m]

screen-256 vs xterm-256 : no difference

konsole : edit current Profile : Mouse : "Copy on select" should be ticked

This works outside of vi, eg, drag-select-copy to system clipboard

bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'r' send -X rectangle-toggle

Something in vi is blocking the mouse select operation

need to use shift.. lol..
