Research suggests that IOS 13 might be a culprit. 
Seems to be related to MFI bugs

IOS 13 was released September 19...  That is a little later
than when I think I started to notice the problems...

I manually upgraded to 13.2.3 (wish I kept the previous 
version somewhere)

Following up to the 'beeping happens on start of audio event'.

It seems to take a while 5, 10, 60 minutes to start beeping when 
I arrive in the Office....

I have noticed it seems to happen at the start of some audio event,
eg keyboard activity, mouse click activity, sudden noise

Moving out of the office for a short while, then moving back in 
seems to help ?

it also happens at home when I have bluetooth speakers hooked up to my
laptop.

We did get new WAPs

===

Still getting feedback/beeps even after:

. temporary new unit to replace my old unit while it was being refreshed.
. complete refresh of hearing aid.
. new mould.

Tried : removing the dell usb receiver and using wired keyboard/mice
	still happens ..

Tried : disabling bluetooth on my phone
	still happens ..

Hearing aid issues - possibly bluetooth related

Original email sent 6.October

I've been getting a significant amount of what seems to be Bluetooth interference (such as a half-second beep every 5 seconds for 1 minute) with my hearing aid at my work.  The following seems to be relevant factors:

. It only happens in the Work office, not outside in the street or at home or anywhere else really.
. The beeping/feedback is very intermittent in frequency/duration etc.
. When I am alone early in the office, the beeping/feedback is almost non-existent.
. As soon as colleagues arrive at work and start using their computers (and bluetooth mice/keyboard and bluetooth headsets), then the inteference starts.
. I've tried the following : Removing my own Bluetooth keyboard/Mice.  Turning off Bluetooth on my iphone.
. I've been trying to correlate my colleagues actions with the feedback/inteference, but nothing obvious is standing out.

If you have any suggestions on what to do or try out I'd be grateful. It's getting to the point where it's becoming more than just an annoyance.

Many thanks - Dave
