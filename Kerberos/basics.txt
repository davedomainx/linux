service; these generally need to be set manually by an AD admin
    For service principals, generally, instead of using a password a random key is generated and stored both in the KDC and in a file called a 'Keytab'.
    Keytab files generally do not expire.
    For the service principal, how do I get the keytab from the KDC? Do I even need it ? user and host do not have their principals manually copied to the keytab, it's automatically handled by the KDC .. ?

492  export KRB5_KTNAME=/etc/AFS.keytab
501  net ads keytab CREATE
502  net ads keytab ADD AFS
506  klist -k -e /etc/AFS.keytab

Try deleting the offending computer principal from AD.
Rejoin with “/usr/bin/net ads join -U djaccount%XXXXXXXX osname=/bin/uname -s osver=CentOS” ## Usually works here …

net ads status -P
net ads dns register -P
net ads status -P
