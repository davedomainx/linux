throughput-performance
             Profile for typical throughput performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms and  enables
             sysctl  settings that improve the throughput performance of your disk and network IO. CPU gover‐
             nor is set to performance and CPU energy performance bias is set to performance. Disk  readahead
             values are increased.

      latency-performance
             Profile  for  low latency performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms.  CPU governor is
             set to performance andlocked to the low C states (by PM QoS).  CPU energy  performance  bias  to
             performance.

      network-throughput
             Profile  for  throughput  network  tuning. It is based on the throughput-performance profile. It
             additionaly increases kernel network buffers.

      network-latency
             Profile for low latency network tuning. It is based on the latency-performance profile. It addi‐
             tionaly  disables  transparent hugepages, NUMA balancing and tunes several other network related
             sysctl parameters.
