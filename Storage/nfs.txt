specific mount options:

soft/hard = use hard in Clustered environment
noac = for use in clustered environments, multiple clients.  Huge performance
penalty
bg = if a mount fails, fork a child mount and continue to try mounting
fg = fail immediately

it seems that setting noactime=0 is better than noac ?
sharecache may be useful for /home
