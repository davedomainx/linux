In our environment, we have the following set:
  noac  : disable client-file attribute caching,
  async : set by implication


specific mount options:

fsc / nofsc
Enable/Disables the cache of (read-only) data pages to the local disk using
the FS-Cache facility. See cachefilesd(8)  and
<kernel_soruce>/Docu‐mentation/filesystems/caching for detail on how to
configure the FS-Cache facility.  Default value is nofsc.

rdirplus / nordirplus ** try nordirplus **
Selects whether to use NFS v3 or v4 READDIRPLUS requests.  If this option is
not specified, the NFS client uses READDIRPLUS requests on NFS v3 or
v4 mounts to read small directories.  Some applications perform better if
the client uses only READDIR requests for all directories.

soft/hard = use hard in Clustered environment

noacl = is a solaris feature, not used in linux and plain mounts dont
use it

noac = Prevent client from caching file attributes. Use this in clustered environments
for coherency. Huge performance penalty.  Note that "noac" seems to imply
synchronous writes (man nfs : noac)

  In  addition  to preventing the client from caching file
  attributes, the noac option forces application writes to
  become  synchronous  so  that  local  changes  to a file
  become visible on the  server  immediately.   That  way,
  other clients can quickly detect recent writes when they
  check the file’s attributes.

  Using the noac option provides greater  cache  coherence
  among  NFS  clients  accessing  the  same  files, but it
  extracts a significant performance  penalty.   As  such,
  judicious  use  of  file  locking is encouraged instead.
  The DATA  AND  METADATA  COHERENCE  section  contains  a
  detailed discussion of these trade-offs.


bg = if a mount fails, fork a child mount and continue to try mounting
fg = fail immediately

it seems that setting actime=0 is better than noac ?
sharecache may be useful for /home
