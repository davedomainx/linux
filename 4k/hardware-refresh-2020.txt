bought a 49" monitor.
I need something decent to drive the 49".

My worsktation is a low-spec beelink NUC bought cheaply and the video isn't great.
My windows laptop is 5 years old and only really used for WoW and for Conny's work.

I do most of my heavy duty development off the SuperMicro "daveserver", which gets
alot of use as a Vagrant/Virtual/Docker host.  

I simply don't know what to get between these:

Laptops
=======
MacBook Air
  Pros : Superb. Hook into the iMac.
  Cons : 
MacBook Pro
  Pros : Everything
  Cons : Costs, Weight
Windows
  Pros : the Zenbook was superb

NUC
===
mini Mac
generic NUC
