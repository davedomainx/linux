bought a 49" monitor 5120x1440.
I want (need) something decent to drive the 49".

------------------------
Hardware rationalisation

Starting to get an increasing number of devices.  Time to clean up a bit ?

beelink NUC
Zenbook Laptop
SuperMicro server

My worsktation is a low-spec beelink NUC bought on the cheap and it seems to struggle 
driving 4k resolution, and/or it has issues with the 4k monitor.
Zenbook windows laptop is 5 years old and only really used for WoW and for Conny's work.
.. zenbook has been excellent

Is there a single-solution which can care for the functionality of the below?
. beelink Linux NUC
. zenbook windows Laptop
. SuperMicro server (ZFS Storage)

In short - No.

  Combine the NUC and Laptop - just get a good laptop ..
    I need to be mobile.
      The questions are:
        how much oomph to go mobile is required ?
        how much oomph to use VirtualBox/Vagrant is required ?
        Realistically how often do I need to go mobile and do heavy dev work ?
        Assume want at least 1TB SSD for triple-boot.

Pricing - baseline on i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD
Problem is 2k EUD minimum spend ...

  MacMini
    3.6 Ghz i7 4-core 8-thread boostable to 4.6 Ghz
    16G RAM
    1 TB SSD
    2059 EUD
    Alot of $ for a NUC

  MacAir 13
    1.2 Ghz i7 4-core 8-thread boostable to 3.8 Ghz
    16G RAM
    1 TB SSD
    2100 EUD
    Quite a bit of $ for the basic model

  MacBook Pro 13
    2.3 Ghz i7 4-core 8-thread boostable to 4.1 Ghz
    16G RAM
    1 TB SSD
    2729 EUD

  MacBook Pro 16
    2.3 Ghz i9 8-core 16-thread (!) boostable to 4.8 Ghz
    16G RAM
    1 TB SSD
    3330 EUD
    This is actually by far the best bang for buck - 16" and ridiculous CPU
    
I do most of my heavy duty development off the SuperMicro "daveserver", which gets
alot of use as a Vagrant/Virtual/Docker host.
  The SuperMicro (built 2016) is starting to show it's age a bit..
  Think need to keep the SuperMicro for the 6TB ZFS storage and ECC memory.
  Or - really should consider cloud-storage ..
    Cloud-based Fileserver (stupid..)

As of May2020, windows laptops seem very cheap

7.May
  thinking Macs are the way to go - either mini or air.  Can dual/triple boot.

Laptops
=======
MacBook Air
  Pros : Superb.
  Cons : Can't do heavy duty stuff if I need to go mobile.  No native Windows. 
MacBook Pro
  Pros : Everything
  Cons : Costs, Weight.  No native Windows platform
Windows/Linux
  Pros : the Zenbook was superb.  Gaming.  Windows 10 native.
  Cons : Might struggle to find a laptop to display 5120x1440.

NUC
===
mini Mac
  Pros : Great kit for great price.  Can Triple boot MacOS, Linux, Windows 10..
  Cons : Can't easily use it as a mobile device.  Costly if I get 1-2TB SSDs for Triple-boot.
generic NUC
  Pros : Windows native

Zenbook
=======

UM425IA : not out yet as of 18.Aug.2020
