bought a 49" monitor 5120x1440.
I need something decent to drive the 49".

My worsktation is a low-spec beelink NUC bought cheaply and the video isn't great.
My windows laptop is 5 years old and only really used for WoW and for Conny's work.

I dont know whether to go for a Mac or go for Windows.

I do most of my heavy duty development off the SuperMicro "daveserver", which gets
alot of use as a Vagrant/Virtual/Docker host.

As of May2020, windows laptops seem cheap

  thinking the Macs are the way to go - either mini or air.  Can dualboot.  Triple (Mac, Windows, Linux)
  seems harder due to boot camp only liking 2 partitions?
