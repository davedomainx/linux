The 4k and 2k monitor setup hasn't really worked out.  Too many 
issues with fractional scaling even after going to 20.04.  The 
2k was meant to be the 'reading/browsing' monitor but the resolution 
squashes the width when in 90 degree orientation.

Curved Ultrawide seems to be an excellent productivity choice.

Note my rpi 4 has Thunderbolt and handles 4k resolution, so in theory 
it should be a suitable display-host, but it will be glacially slow.
The beelink doesnt have Thunderbolt unfortunately.

Will my vesa monitor arm handle 100x100 ?
  No, need to purchase a 75x75 to 100x100 adapter - they are available
  The monitor arm has a max weight of 6.5kgs and max size of 43-68.5 cm (17"-27")

Requirements
============
3440x1440, 21:9
34 inch
Thunderbolt 3 ?
  USB4 coming out 2020-2021 
    USB4 backwards compatible with TB3 and USB-C
      They all use the same connector : USB-C
    I will need to replace the zenbook and beelink in the next couple of years.
    maybe this is a strong case to get the TB3 for max flexibility options?
    TB3 is basically adding 150-200 EUD to the cost of the monitor ..
  USB-C connector might be the best option.
Vesa mount
  ultrawides seem to come with 100x100 VESA mounts
  Unfortunately most monitor arms seem to max out at 10kgs
  this is okay : AmazonBasics Height Adjustable Steel Monitor Stand
