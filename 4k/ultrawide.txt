The 4k and 2k monitor setup hasn't really worked out.  Too many issues with fractional scaling even after going to 20.04.  The 2k was meant to be the 'reading/browsing' monitor but the resolution squashes the width when in 90 degree orientation.

Curved Ultrawide seems to be an excellent productivity choice.

Note my rpi 4 has Thunderbolt and handles 4k resolution, so in theory it should be a suitable display-host, but it will be glacially slow.
The beelink doesnt have Thunderbolt unfortunately.

Will my vesa monitor arm handle 100x100 ?
  No, need to purchase a 75x75 to 100x100 adapter - they are available
  The monitor arm has a max weight of 6.5kgs and max size of 43-68.5 cm (17"-27")
