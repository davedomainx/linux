The 4k and 2k monitor setup hasn't really worked out.  Too many 
issues with fractional scaling even after going to 20.04.  The 
2k was meant to be the 'reading/browsing' monitor but the resolution 
squashes the width when in 90 degree orientation.

The 4k is starting to black out frequently on heavy duty apps.  Turning 
the power on/off temporarily fixes it.  Probably xorg related.

Curved Ultrawide seems to be an excellent productivity choice.

Thoughts
========
5120x1440, 32:9, 49"
3440x1440, 21:9, 34"

34 inch
  Starting to wonder if 34 will be enough.
    got a 28" and a 23" .. a 34" will practically be identical.
    If I'm spending 6-7-8 hundred euros should I go higher to get a really good monitor ?
    Tape measure diagonally with my 4k and 2k setup is 43"
  
Strongly tempted to go for 43-44, but the resolutions aren't right.
That is 32:10 3840x1200
  Which is exactly the same as 2x 1920x1200 monitors side-by-side.

38s and 43s have 1200 vertical resolution - which is same as old 1920x1200

49 inch
  5120x1440

KVM Switch
  This would be nice to have, but not essential.
    Mainly for when setting up hardware.
  It seems to be standard on high-end monitors.
  Dell and Phillips have these on their ultrawides.  
  Dell seems to have best functionality.

Thunderbolt 3 ?
  USB4 coming out 2020-2021 
    USB4 backwards compatible with TB3 and USB-C
      They all use the same connector : USB-C
    I will need to replace the zenbook and beelink in the next couple of years.
    maybe this is a strong case to get the TB3 for max flexibility options?
    TB3 is basically adding 150-200 EUD to the cost of the monitor ..
  USB-C connector might be the best option.

Vesa mount
  Ultrawides seem to come with 100x100 VESA mounts.
  Unfortunately most monitor arms seem to max out at 10kgs.
  this is okay : AmazonBasics Height Adjustable Steel Monitor Stand.
  Will my 75x75 vesa monitor arm handle 100x100 ?
  No, need to purchase a 75x75 to 100x100 adapter - they are available
  The monitor arm has a max weight of 6.5kgs and max size of 43-68.5 cm (17"-27")

Monitors - 49

3.May
  Now starting to think 49" 
  The beelink can drive 5120x1440 - its less than 3840x2160 (4k).
