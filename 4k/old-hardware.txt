PC-Hardware that I've had (that I can remember)

PCs
Beige Gamign box.  Threw out when I left Gero.
Acer-all-in-one.  Think bought in Gero and took to Berlin.

Laptops
Old MacBook : 2006-2012 : almost never used.  Bought Apple store NYC, sold when I left Gero.
Zenbook : 2015-2020 : superb.  Bought in Berlin.

NUCS
rpi 3 (2018-)
rpi 4 (2019-)
both rpis rarely used.  The 3 isn't powerful enough and the 4 has heat issues.

beelink x55 : 2018-2020 : Pretty good for price.  Issues driving 4k resolution.

Monitors
--------
Samsung 27 : 1920x1200 : Fine, no VESA mount.  In garage.
Philips 24 243V5 : 1920x1200 : Fine, VESA mount.
