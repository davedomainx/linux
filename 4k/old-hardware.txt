PC-Hardware that I've had (that I can remember)

---
PCs
Beige Gamign box.  Threw out when I left Gero.
Acer-all-in-one.  Think bought in Gero and took to Berlin.

-------
Laptops
White MacBook : 2006-2012 : almost never used.  Bought Apple store NYC, sold when I left Gero.
  This was Apple pre-iphone ....
Zenbook : 2015-2020 : superb.  Bought in Berlin.

----
NUCS
rpi 3 (2018-)
rpi 4 (2019-)
both rpis rarely used.  The 3 isn't powerful enough and the 4 has heat issues.

beelink x55 : 2018-2020 : Excellent, main home workstationgoo for price.  Issues driving 4k resolution.

--------
Monitors
Samsung 27 : 1920x1200 : Fine, no VESA mount, stupid shape of back of monitor means even VESA adapters
probably not worth it.
  Threw in electrical recycle garbage May2020.

Philips 24 243V5 : 1920x1200 : Fine, VESA mount, will keep even if almost no use/requirement for it.

AOC 27 U2879VF : 4k : No VESA mount, 1x Dead pixel on unpacking, power-resume issues [with beelink], 
                     at Work-Office since May2019 for further testing/evaluation, again stupid shape
                     on back of monitor means
