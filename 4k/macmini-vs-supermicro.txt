Initial investigation into macmini vs supermicro specs in regards 
to replacing supermicro.

CPU wise the macmini shits all over the supermicro.
Would love to see Ryzen in macmini but Apple will never(?) use them.

I have the SuperMicro for the ECC memory and 6TB usable storage.
  I'm only using 1.1TB out of the 6GB usable, and that was b4 I
  turned on lz4 compression ..
