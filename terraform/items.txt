Remote State
============

Need to specify how to utilise a different remote state..

To use a remote state 'B' from another state 'A':
  in B, create an output for whatever needs to be outputted
  in A, specify B remote_state details as a data source - like so:
     data.terraform_remote_state.B.outputs.variable_name
