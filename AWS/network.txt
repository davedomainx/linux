ENI : Network Interface.  All EC2s instances are launched with a default, primary, un-modifiable ENI (eth0).
You can attach additional ENIs to the instance.  You can have multiple IP addresses on the ENI.

A primary private IPv4 address is assigned to the default ENI of the instance, or you can assign one
yourself.

Subnets have an 'auto assign public ipv4' setting.  

Some AWS managed services also automatically create an ENI (Transit Gateway etc)

EIP : Elastic IP address.  Persistent public IPv4 address.  Associate the EIP with an instance or an ENI.
If you associate the EIP with the primary/default eth0, then whatever IPv4 address it had originally is 
released back to AWS.
