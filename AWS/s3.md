Is my bucket public or private ?

if you need multiple, seperated methods of accessing S3 bucks, eg,
through a company firewall AND through AWS itself via VPCE,
the 'ifexists' bucket policy can be used to safely evaluate
that one of the methods is 'true' (exists) and the policy suceeds.

If you DONT use 'ifexists' when you need multiple accesses, you 
end up denying a valid-

( I need to word the above better to make it clearer to understand )

"ifexists" is a short-circuit to quickly evaluate if stringnotequalifexists
or notipaddressifexists is valid/true.

"Deny if either stringnotequalifexists or notipaddressifexists
is valid".  In this case, Deny if the request doesnt come from
the sourceVPCE or the sourceIP address.

action : s3.GetObject
resource : arn:aws:s3:some_bucket
effect : deny
principal : *
condition :
	stringnotequalifexists:
	  aws:SourceVpce
		VPCE#1,
		VPCE#2,
	notipaddressifexists:
	  aws:sourceIP
		a.b.c.d
		e.f.g.h

======

"Allow if either stringequalsifexists or ipaddressifexists
is valid".  In this case, Allow if the request comes from
either the sourceVPCE or the sourceIP address.

action : s3.ListBucket
resource : arn:aws:s3:some_bucket
effect : allow
principal : *
condition :
	stringequalsifexists:
	  aws:SourceVpce
		VPCE#1,
		VPCE#2,
	ipaddressifexists:
	  aws:sourceIP
		a.b.c.d
		e.f.g.h
