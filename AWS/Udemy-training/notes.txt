good security stuff:

Guardduty : monitor for malicious activity
Inspector : vuln reports
Macie : s3 bucket analyzer

==
S3

anything modified new etc is always private by default
versioning keeps everything really

cross replication buckets
	. versioning must be enabled on both source and dest bucks.
	. deletions on master/primary buck not automatically replicated to 
	slave buck - security feature.

lifecycle
	. controls how/when objects are transitioned to other storage

cloudfront
	. nothing obvious
	. lecture was very different to what's actually on AWS

storage gateways
	. file : flat files stored on S3
	. storage volume : backup local storage to AWS S3 as EBS snapshots.
	. cached volumnes : cached volumes in S3 and most frequently accessed
	is cached on site.
	. tape gateway : Virtual Tape Library VTL to Glacier.

snowballs
	. replaced import/export (send in your own disks).
	. standard hardware TPM where you store data to be uploaded to AWS.
	. edge is bigger than standard.
	. snowmobile is a containerized truck.
