. aws this week - review it every week see whats new

account

AWS Sign in string = aliased to darnold1978

sudo apt install awscli

===

good security stuff:

Guardduty : monitor for malicious activity
Inspector : vuln reports
Macie : s3 bucket analyzer

==
S3
==
anything modified new etc is always private by default
versioning keeps everything really

cross replication buckets
	. versioning must be enabled on both source and dest bucks.
	. deletions on master/primary buck not automatically replicated to 
	slave buck - security feature.

lifecycle
	. controls how/when objects are transitioned to other storage

cloudfront
	. nothing obvious
	. lecture was very different to what's actually on AWS

storage gateways
	. file : flat files stored on S3
	. storage volume : backup local storage to AWS S3 as EBS snapshots.
	. cached volumnes : cached volumes in S3 and most frequently accessed
	is cached on site.
	. tape gateway : Virtual Tape Library VTL to Glacier.

snowballs
	. replaced import/export (send in your own disks).
	. standard hardware TPM where you store data to be uploaded to AWS.
	. edge is bigger than standard.
	. snowmobile is a containerized truck.


s3 static website

s3 review
	. read/write consistency puts/deletes etc ?

EC2
===

puttygen = convert .pem to ppk

. need to understand different EC2 types
	normal, reserved, spot, dedicated ..
. need to understand different EBS types

1 subnet = 1 AZ

SecGroups
	all inbound blocked by default.

	Automatically stateful - adding an inbound rule automatically
	creates the outbound rule (?!).  Hm even if you delete the
	allow all outbound rule, traffic still goes out - ?

	note he said secgroups can be a bit buggy :P

EBS
	Can modify volume type in real time ?!

	Volumes always in the same AZ as the EC2 instance.

	To move volumes from one AZ to another, create snapshot,
	create image from snapshot ..

	snapshot - copy can move volume to another region.
	snaphots are only incrememntal - only blocks changed since
	last snapshot are copied.

	snaps of encrypted volumes and automatically encyrpted.

	AMI - can copy to another region.

	RAID5 on EBS = AWS say no!

	Use RAID on AWS when you are not getting expected disk
	performance.

	C.f. with Windows AMIs - not free tier!
	
	RAID5 normal stuff when snaphostting - quiesce the disks,
	umount the RAID array, shutdown associated EC2

	Instance stores = cannot stop, only reboot or terminate

** EBS volumes : root dev for an instance launched from AMI is an EBS volume
created from an EBS snapshot **

** Instance store volumes : root dev comes from AMI template stored in S3 **

ELB
	. nothing new here
	. AWS significantly different to what is in the course
	. 50X = server side http error
	. 40X = client side http error
	. secgroup needed allow anywhere port 80 - assume LB issue

===
Cloudwatch
	. Disk/Network/CPU metrics available by default
	. Basic datapoint = 5 minutes, advanced = 1 minute
