ebs vs instance store (ephermeral).
	I really need to ace what this is.
	Instance store/ephermeral cannot be stopped - if the host
		fails you lose the data.

	ebs can be stopped - you wont lose the data

	ebs root volume deleted on termination by default.  you can
	tell it not to delete the root volume

cloudwatch
