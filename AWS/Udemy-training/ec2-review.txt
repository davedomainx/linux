Cannot move reserved ec2 from one region to the other.

Placing ec2 in public subnet in custom VPC does not make the EC2
automatically internet accessible - why not ? Need to apply EIP
or ELB to the instance ?
	new EC2 always given private + public IPs ?

ec2 price models
	on demand
		you pay for what you use
	spot - spare compute capacity
		you bid a price and if the spot price matches you 
			get ec2 provisioned
		if aws terminate you get the hour free
		if you terminate you pay for the hour
	reserved
		you lease capacity by 1-3 years
	dedicated hosts
		physical ec2 server

instance store (ephermeral) vs EBS.

	I really need to ace what this is.

	Instance store/ephermeral cannot be stopped - if the host
		fails you lose the data.

	Instance stores are fragile - they exist only for the lifetime
	of the instance.

	ebs can be stopped - you wont lose the data

	ebs root volume deleted on termination by default.  you can
	tell it not to delete the root volume

	ebs cannot be detached if it is the root volume of an instance.
	ebs can be detached if it is not the root volume of an instance.
